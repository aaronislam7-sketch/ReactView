# Template Design Blueprint
## The Gold Standard for Knode Video Templates

This document defines the principles, patterns, and quality standards that every template must meet. Use this as a validation checklist for all template creation and updates.

---

## Core Philosophy

> **"Conversational, not presentational. Dynamic, not static. Educational, not decorative."**

Every template should feel like a skilled teacher explaining a concept face-to-face - dynamic, responsive, and always moving the conversation forward.

---

## 1. Motion Principles

### **A. Conversational Choreography**

Templates should follow a **conversational flow** where elements enter, serve their purpose, then gracefully exit to make room for the next idea.

#### ✅ DO:
- **Enter → Serve → Exit**: Every element has a lifecycle
- **Clear the stage**: Remove elements when they're no longer needed
- **Make room**: Elements move to create space for what's next
- **Transform mid-scene**: Bold repositioning (shrink, move, scale)
- **Give breathing room**: Allow 0.8-1.5s between major transitions

#### ❌ DON'T:
- Leave everything on screen at once
- Have static elements that just sit there
- Jump between states without transitions
- Rush transitions - let motion complete

**Example from Hook1A:**
```
Question 1 appears → moves up → Question 2 appears below →
both pulse → WIPE stage left → Map appears center →
Map transforms to corner → Welcome takes center stage
```

### **B. GSAP Animation Standards**

All motion must use GSAP with proper easing and duration.

#### Easing Standards:
- **Entrances**: `back.out(1.5-1.8)` - Energetic, welcoming
- **Exits**: `power3.in` - Smooth departure
- **Mid-scene moves**: `power3.inOut` - Purposeful repositioning
- **Emphasis**: `sine.inOut` with yoyo - Subtle, natural

#### Duration Standards:
- **Quick entrance**: 0.7-0.9s
- **Standard move**: 1.0-1.3s
- **Slow transformation**: 1.5-2.0s
- **Subtle breathe**: 2.5-3.5s (infinite loop)

#### Breathing Room:
- **After entrance**: 0.8-1.2s before next action
- **After exit**: 0.8-1.0s before revealing next element
- **After transformation**: 1.0-1.5s before new content
- **Between pulses**: 0.3-0.5s

### **C. Zero Wobble + Strategic Rough**

Balance precision with personality.

#### Zero Wobble (Structure):
```javascript
// For structural elements, frames, grids
{
  roughness: 0,
  bowing: 0,
  strokeWidth: 4-6,
}
```

#### Strategic Rough (Emphasis):
```javascript
// For annotations, underlines, highlights
{
  roughness: 0.9-1.3,
  bowing: 3-6,
  strokeWidth: 4-7,
}
```

**Rule**: Structure is precise. Emphasis is rough.

### **D. Camera Motion**

Subtle, ambient drift - never distracting.

```javascript
const cameraDrift = {
  x: Math.sin(frame * 0.008) * 2,  // ±2px max
  y: Math.cos(frame * 0.006) * 1.5, // ±1.5px max
};
```

Never zoom or pan dramatically - let content do the moving.

---

## 2. Visual Principles

### **A. Typography Hierarchy**

#### Font Usage:
- **Headers/Titles**: Permanent Marker (brand energy)
- **Body/Supporting**: Inter or DM Sans (clarity)
- **Emphasis**: Permanent Marker (draws attention)

#### Size Hierarchy:
- **Hero text**: 72-92px (main hook)
- **Section headers**: 48-64px
- **Body text**: 24-32px
- **Supporting text**: 18-24px

### **B. Rough.js Decorations**

Headers must have rough.js visual emphasis.

#### Decoration Types:
1. **Boxes**: Frame important headers
2. **Underlines**: Single or double for emphasis
3. **Circles**: Around key numbers or icons
4. **Arrows**: Show direction or flow

**Timing**: Decorations appear 0.5-1.0s AFTER the text lands.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Text appears at frame 100
// Decoration starts drawing at frame 115-130
if (frame >= beats.welcome + 25) {
  const boxProgress = Math.min((frame - beats.welcome - 25) / 35, 1);
  // Draw box around welcome text
}
```

### **C. Color Philosophy**

#### Brand Palette:
- **Background**: Warm cream `#FFF9F0` or clean white `#FAFBFC`
- **Primary accent**: Bold orange `#FF6B35` (energy, hooks)
- **Secondary accent**: Bold purple `#9B59B6` (depth, reflection)
- **Success**: Green `#27AE60` (correct, apply)
- **Info**: Blue `#2E7FE4` (explain, connection)
- **Ink**: `#1A1A1A` (text)

#### Usage Rules:
- **Hook templates**: Orange + Purple
- **Explain templates**: Blue + Green/Purple
- **Apply templates**: Green + Orange
- **Reflect templates**: Purple + Blue

### **D. Spacing & Composition**

- **Padding**: 80-120px from edges
- **Gap between elements**: 30-40px
- **Center stage**: 60-80% of screen width
- **Transformed elements**: 40-50% scale when moved aside

---

## 3. Pedagogy Principles

### **A. Hook Templates (1A-1E)**

**Goal**: Create curiosity, intrigue, "ooo what is this?" feeling

#### Structure:
1. **Provocative question/statement** (bold entrance)
2. **Visual metaphor/element** (creative, not emoji)
3. **The hook reveal** (THE moment - center stage)
4. **Teaser of journey ahead** (subtle, enticing)

#### User Feeling:
- 😮 "Wait, what?"
- 🤔 "I need to know more"
- ✨ "This is interesting!"

#### Motion Strategy:
- Fast-paced at start (grab attention)
- Build to hook reveal (dramatic)
- Settle with intrigue (leave them wanting more)

**Anti-patterns**:
- Don't give everything away
- Don't use emojis
- Don't feel like a title card

### **B. Explain Templates (2A-2E)**

**Goal**: Clarity through structure, "aha!" moments

#### Structure:
1. **Title/framing** (what are we explaining?)
2. **Core concept** (center focus)
3. **Breakdown/parts** (clear organization)
4. **Connections** (show relationships - PULSE/ANIMATE)
5. **Synthesis** (bring it together)

#### User Feeling:
- 💡 "Aha, I get it!"
- 🎯 "This makes sense"
- 🔗 "I see how these connect"

#### Motion Strategy:
- Methodical reveals (stagger parts)
- Emphasize connections (pulsing lines)
- Mid-scene: reorganize for new perspective

**Anti-patterns**:
- Don't show all parts at once
- Don't have static connections
- Don't overcrowd the screen

### **C. Apply Templates (3A-3E)**

**Goal**: Practice, engagement, confidence building

#### Structure:
1. **Context/scenario** (real-world situation)
2. **Challenge/question** (what to do?)
3. **Options/paths** (choices)
4. **Feedback** (automatic, educational)
5. **Explanation** (why this works)

#### User Feeling:
- 🎮 "I can try this"
- ✅ "I got it right!"
- 📚 "I understand why"

#### Motion Strategy:
- Quick, energetic (keep momentum)
- Clear feedback (visual emphasis)
- Celebration (burst, pulse)

**Anti-patterns**:
- Don't punish wrong answers
- Don't rush through explanation
- Don't make it feel like a test

### **D. Reflect Templates (4A-4E)**

**Goal**: Synthesis, confidence, forward momentum

#### Structure:
1. **Anchor learning** (celebrate achievement)
2. **Key points** (annotated, emphasized)
3. **Connection to journey** (where we've been)
4. **Forward link** (where we're going)

#### User Feeling:
- 🎉 "I learned this!"
- 💪 "I'm making progress"
- 🚀 "I'm ready for more"

#### Motion Strategy:
- Affirming (pulse, check marks)
- Organized (staggered reveals)
- Forward-looking (progression animation)

**Anti-patterns**:
- Don't feel like an ending
- Don't just list points
- Don't skip the "why this matters"

---

## 4. Technical Implementation

### **A. Animation Triggers**

Use state-based triggers to prevent re-firing:

```javascript
const [triggeredAnimations, setTriggeredAnimations] = useState({
  entrance: false,
  transform: false,
  exit: false,
});

useEffect(() => {
  if (frame >= beats.entrance && !triggeredAnimations.entrance && ref.current) {
    gsap.fromTo(ref.current, {...});
    setTriggeredAnimations(prev => ({ ...prev, entrance: true }));
  }
}, [frame, beats.entrance, triggeredAnimations.entrance]);
```

### **B. Beat Timing Structure**

```javascript
const BEAT = 30; // 1 second at 30fps
const beats = {
  prelude: 0,
  action1: BEAT * 0.6,           // Quick start
  action2: BEAT * 2.0,           // After action1 completes (0.6 + 1.4s gap)
  action3: BEAT * 3.5,           // After action2 completes (2.0 + 1.5s gap)
  // ... ensure 0.8-1.5s between major actions
};
```

**Gap Calculation**:
- `nextBeat = previousBeat + animationDuration + breathingRoom`
- Minimum breathing room: 0.8s (24 frames)
- Standard breathing room: 1.0-1.2s (30-36 frames)

### **C. Rough.js Decoration Pattern**

```javascript
// Decoration appears AFTER text lands
if (frame >= beats.textAppears + 25) { // 25 frames = ~0.8s delay
  const progress = Math.min((frame - beats.textAppears - 25) / 35, 1);
  
  const decoration = rc.rectangle(x, y, width * progress, height, {
    stroke: color,
    strokeWidth: 5,
    roughness: 1.2,  // Rough for emphasis
    bowing: 5,
    fill: 'none',
  });
  
  svg.appendChild(decoration);
}
```

### **D. Conditional Rendering**

Only render elements when they're needed:

```javascript
// Show during active period
{frame >= beats.enter && frame < beats.exit && (
  <div ref={ref} style={{ opacity: 0 }}>
    {/* Content */}
  </div>
)}
```

This keeps the DOM clean and improves performance.

## 6. Example: Hook1A Breakdown

### **Timing Analysis** (15 seconds total)

```
0.6s  (18f)  → Question 1 entrance (0.9s animation)
2.0s  (60f)  → Question 1 moves up (0.8s animation)
              [Gap: 0.6s breathing room]
2.8s  (84f)  → Question 2 appears (1.0s animation)
              [Gap: 1.4s for both to land]
4.2s  (126f) → Pulse both (0.4s animation)
              [Gap: 1.3s breathing room]
5.5s  (165f) → Wipe questions exit (1.0s animation)
              [Gap: 1.0s clean stage]
6.5s  (195f) → Map reveals center (1.3s animation)
              [Gap: 2.5s for map to shine]
9.0s  (270f) → Map transforms to corner (1.2s animation)
              [Gap: 1.0s breathing room]
10.0s (300f) → Welcome center stage (1.5s animation)
              [Gap: 2.0s for hook to land]
12.0s (360f) → Subtitle appears (1.0s animation)
              [Gap: 1.5s breathing room]
13.5s (405f) → Breathe animation starts
15.0s (450f) → Settle/hold
```

**Key Observations**:
- Average gap between actions: 1.1s
- Longest gap: 2.5s (let map shine)
- Shortest gap: 0.6s (quick transition)
- Total motion time: ~8s
- Total breathing time: ~7s
- Ratio: ~50/50 motion/breathing

### **Rough.js Decoration Timeline**

```
Question 1 lands at 0.6s
  → Box decoration at 1.1s (+0.5s)
Question 2 lands at 2.8s
  → Underline at 3.5s (+0.7s)
Welcome lands at 10.0s
  → Box at 10.8s (+0.8s)
  → Double underline at 11.4s (+1.4s)
```

**Pattern**: Decorations always trail text by 0.5-1.0s

### **User Emotional Journey**

```
0-3s:   🤔 "Interesting question..."
3-5s:   💭 "These connect somehow..."
5-7s:   👀 "What's appearing?"
7-10s:  ✨ "Ooo, a map!"
10-12s: 🎯 "AHA - Knodovia! What is it?"
12-15s: 🧐 "I want to explore this..."
```

## 7. Template Validation Process

### **Step 1: Motion Test**
- Play template without audio
- Does every element have a clear entry/exit?
- Is there wasted time where nothing happens?
- Are transitions smooth or jarring?

### **Step 2: Pedagogy Test**
- What should the user feel?
- Does the motion support that feeling?
- Is the key learning moment emphasized?
- Would this work without voice-over?

### **Step 3: Cohesion Test**
- Does this feel like part of the Knode family?
- Are colors/fonts consistent?
- Does motion language match other templates?
- Could you identify this as Knode without branding?

### **Step 4: TED-ED Standard**
- Could this appear in a TED-ED video?
- Is every animation purposeful?
- Does it add micro-delights without fluff?
- Would an educator approve?

## 8. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### **❌ The PowerPoint Trap**
**Problem**: Elements just fade in/out with no personality
**Fix**: Use GSAP with back.out easing, scale, rotation

### **❌ The Cluttered Screen**
**Problem**: Everything stays visible at once
**Fix**: Exit elements when done, clear the stage

### **❌ The Rushed Transition**
**Problem**: Next element appears before previous motion completes
**Fix**: Add 0.8-1.5s breathing room between beats

### **❌ The Static Decoration**
**Problem**: Rough.js elements just appear, don't draw
**Fix**: Animate with progress, show stroke-dashoffset

### **❌ The Emoji Shortcut**
**Problem**: Using 🗺️ instead of creating animation
**Fix**: Build creative SVG animations with rough.js

### **❌ The Wobble Overload**
**Problem**: Everything is rough/sketchy, loses impact
**Fix**: Zero wobble on structure, rough on emphasis only

### **❌ The Mechanical Feel**
**Problem**: Everything moves at same speed/easing
**Fix**: Vary duration (0.7-2.0s) and easing per context

### **❌ The Purposeless Animation**
**Problem**: Animation that doesn't serve learning
**Fix**: Ask "does this help understanding?" If no, remove it

## 9. Future Template Guidelines

### **When Creating New Templates:**

1. **Start with pedagogy**
   - What's the learning goal?
   - What should user feel?
   - What's the "aha moment"?

2. **Design the choreography**
   - Map out enter → serve → exit for each element
   - Identify transformation points
   - Plan breathing room

3. **Choose emphasis style**
   - What gets rough.js decoration?
   - When do pulses happen?
   - Where are connection animations?

4. **Prototype timing**
   - Build beat structure
   - Test without content
   - Adjust gaps as needed

5. **Validate against blueprint**
   - Run through quality checklist
   - Compare to reference templates
   - Get feedback

---

## 10. Reference Examples

### **Best Practices Reference:**
- **Hook1A**: Conversational flow, bold transformations
- **Explain2A**: Pulsing connections, dynamic layout
- **Apply3A**: Countdown timer, clear feedback
- **Reflect4A**: Rough annotations, affirmation

### **Key Innovation Examples:**
- **Wipe exit** (Hook1A): Questions exit stage left
- **Transform** (Hook1A): Map shrinks to corner
- **Pulsing lines** (Explain2A): Show relationships
- **Countdown** (Apply3A): Build tension
- **Stepping stones** (Reflect4D): Show progression

## Conclusion

This blueprint is living documentation. As we discover new patterns and techniques, update this document. Every template should:

1. ✅ Follow motion principles (conversational, GSAP-driven)
2. ✅ Support pedagogy (right feeling for learning goal)
3. ✅ Maintain brand cohesion (colors, fonts, rough.js)
4. ✅ Meet quality standards (checklist validated)
5. ✅ Avoid anti-patterns (no PowerPoint, no clutter)

**When in doubt, ask:**
> "Does this help the learner understand, or is it just decoration?"

If it's just decoration, remove it. If it helps understanding, make it **bold and beautiful**.
