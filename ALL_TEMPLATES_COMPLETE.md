## ðŸ’¡ Recommendation

Since you're happy with Hook1A, Hook1E, and Explain2A, I can:

**Option A:** Continue implementing all 5 remaining templates now (Est: 1-2 hours)

**Option B:** You test the 3 complete ones thoroughly, then I finish the last 5

**Option C:** I do 2-3 more now, you test, then final batch

**What works best for you?** The pattern is proven and working beautifully! ðŸš€

All 3 completed templates are pushed to your PR and ready to test!
