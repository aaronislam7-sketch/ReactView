- ⏳ Hook1EAmbientMystery.jsx (0/4 rough.js calls)
- ⏳ Explain2AConceptBreakdown.jsx (0/6 rough.js calls)

**Total:** 0/36 rough.js calls updated

### 4. Fix Template 3B Overlap (PENDING)
- Issue: Text overlapping box outline at 2s
- Root cause: Scenario text positioning
- Fix: Adjust positioning + padding

## 📋 TODO (Phase 2 - Features)

- [ ] Actually integrate anime.js (replace Remotion interpolate for complex animations)
- [ ] Add Lottie support (JSON schema + component integration)
