### Solution:
```

```

---

## Problem 6: Animations Not Playing

### Symptoms:
- Video loads
- Shows static image
- Nothing moves when playing

### Solution A: Check Frame Counter
```
1. Look at timeline (bottom of player)
2. Numbers should change when playing
3. If stuck at 0: Player issue
4. If moving: Animation timing issue
```

### Solution B: Verify Scene Data
```
1. Look at JSON on left side
2. Check duration_s value (should be 30)
3. Check fps value (should be 30)
4. If missing: Add them
```

2. Select template from dropdown

3. Should show 4 scenes
4. If less than 4: Missing scene data
```

### Solution C: Simplify
```
1. Go to Step 1
2. Click "Approve & Continue" (don't edit)
3. Repeat for Steps 2, 3, 4
4. Use default scenes only
5. Check if Step 5 works now
```

## Problem 8: Eraser Transitions Not Showing

### Symptoms:
- Final video plays
- Scenes appear
- But transitions are instant cuts

### Expected Behavior:
```
You SHOULD see:
- Gray/pink eraser tool sweep across
- Previous scene being wiped away
- Smooth transition (not instant cut)

Duration: ~0.67 seconds per transition
```

### Solution:
```
This is likely working correctly!
Transitions are QUICK (20 frames = 0.67s)
Try:
1. Scrub timeline slowly
2. Look between scenes
3. You'll see brief eraser animation
```

---

## Problem 9: Images Not Loading

### Symptoms:
- Text appears
- Placeholders where icons should be
- Broken image icons

### Solution A: Check Internet
```
Images use external URLs from:
- api.dicebear.com

If offline or blocked:
- Images won't load
- Rest of video works fine
```

### Solution B: Update Image Library
```
1. Edit: src/utils/imageLibrary.js
2. Replace URLs with local images
3. Or use different CDN
```

---

## Problem 10: Performance Issues

### Symptoms:
- Video stutters
- Choppy playback
- Slow scrubbing

### Solution A: Check System Resources
```
1. Close other browser tabs
2. Close heavy applications
3. Video rendering is CPU-intensive
```

### Solution B: Reduce Quality
```
In browser console (F12):
1. Type: document.querySelector('video').playbackRate = 0.5
2. Plays at half speed (smoother)
```

### Solution C: Use Smaller Window
```
1. Reduce browser window size
2. Don't use fullscreen
3. Lower resolution = faster rendering
```

---

## Problem 11: JSON Changes Don't Apply

### Symptoms:
- Edit JSON
- Click "Apply Changes"
- Preview doesn't update

### Solution A: Check for JSON Errors
```
Look for validation messages:
- Red error box = JSON syntax error
- Yellow warning = Scene validation issue

Fix:
1. Check all brackets match { }
2. Check all quotes are paired " "
3. No trailing commas
4. Valid JSON structure
```

### Solution B: Manual Refresh
```
1. After clicking "Apply Changes"
2. Wait 1 second
3. Player should update automatically
4. If not: Refresh browser (F5)
```

---

## Emergency Fallbacks

### Fallback 1: Use Legacy Mode
```
1. Click "Switch to Legacy Mode" (bottom-right)
2. This uses simpler, more stable viewer
3. Preview individual scenes one at a time
4. Less features but more reliable
```

### Fallback 2: Direct Component Test
```
1. Go to Legacy Mode
2. Select "Whiteboard TED Enhanced"
3. If this works: Templates are fine
4. Issue is with Wizard component
```

### Fallback 3: Fresh Start
```
# Terminal:
Ctrl+C (stop dev server)
npm install
npm run dev

# Browser:
Clear cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
Close all tabs
Open new tab â†’ http://localhost:3000
```
