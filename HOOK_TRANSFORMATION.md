# Hook Template - Complete Redesign ✨

## What Changed

I've **completely rebuilt** the Hook template from scratch based on your cinematic write-on brief. This isn't an iteration—it's a full replacement prioritizing motion, rhythm, and visual storytelling.

---

## 🎬 Core Transformation

### Before: Static Whiteboard
- Text appeared in boxes all at once
- Emoji and badges but mostly decoration
- Gentle breathing animations
- 35 seconds, leisurely pace
- Centered, symmetric layouts

### After: Cinematic Write-On
- Every element draws on like pen on paper
- Visual anchors integral to every beat
- Beat-grid timing (1.2s intervals)
- 12 seconds, tight rhythm
- Asymmetric, directed layouts
- Micro-camera motion (zoom + drift)
- Pen tips follow reveals
- Connecting lines between elements

---

## 🎯 Implementation Details

### 1. **Reduced Text Dominance** ✅

**Before:**
```
"Can You Actually Get Smarter?"
```

**After:**
```
Beat 1: "What if losing consciousness"
Beat 2: "made you smarter?"
```

- Split into 3-6 word chunks
- Each chunk gets own beat
- Write-on reveal (not static dump)
- Pen tip follows animation

### 2. **Visual Anchors Integrated** ✅

Every beat now has a visual element:

- **Beats 1-2:** Question text with pen tip + underline drawing
- **Beat 3:** Central icon with sketched circle outline (draws on)
- **Beats 4-6:** Three sparks, each with:
  - Numbered badge (visual anchor)
  - 3-word text chunk
  - Write-on reveal
- **Beat 8:** Challenge in colored box with sketch bracket
- **Throughout:** Connecting lines that draw between sparks

**Visual-to-text ratio:** Now ~50/50 vs. previously ~20/80

### 3. **Write-On Primary Mechanic** ✅

All reveals use pen-logic animations:

- **Text:** Left-to-right clipPath with opacity fade
- **Lines:** SVG strokeDashoffset (draws like pen)
- **Circles:** Clockwise stroke reveal
- **Pen tips:** 8px dots that follow write-on progress
- **Brackets:** Draw-on borders for emphasis

**Speed hierarchy:**
- Titles: 20 frames (0.67s) - slower for emphasis
- Sparks: 18 frames (0.6s) - medium speed
- Lines: 25 frames (0.83s) - slower for visibility
- Challenge: 25 frames (0.83s) - important, lingers

### 4. **Beat-Based Rhythm** ✅

Fixed beat grid at 1.2s (36 frames) intervals:

```
Beat 0:   Prelude (camera prep)
Beat 1:   "What if losing consciousness"
Beat 2:   "made you smarter?"
Beat 2.5: Underline draws
Beat 3:   Central icon + circle
Beat 4:   Spark 1 (left side)
Beat 5.2: Spark 2 (right side) 
Beat 6.4: Spark 3 (bottom center)
Beat 7.6: PAUSE (breathing space)
Beat 8.2: Challenge revealed
Beat 9.5: Settle & fade
```

**Hierarchical pauses:**
- Every 3 beats has slight stagger (0.2 beat offset)
- One major pause at beat 7.6 (after sparks, before challenge)
- Gives "TED-Ed heartbeat" rhythm

### 5. **Layout Rules** ✅

**24-column × 14-row grid** with 8px snap:

- **Center (cols 11-15):** Reserved for central icon
- **Left (cols 2-9):** Spark 1, asymmetric
- **Right (cols 16-23):** Spark 2, balance
- **Bottom (cols 8-17):** Spark 3, foundation
- **Top (cols 3-23):** Question, left-aligned (not centered!)
- **Mid-overlay (cols 5-21):** Challenge, slight rotation (-1deg)

**Negative space:** ~60% of canvas empty at any moment

**Asymmetry:**
- Question left-aligned
- Sparks form triangle (not line)
- Challenge rotated -1deg
- Connecting lines are curved, not straight

### 6. **Micro-Camera Motion** ✅

**Zoom:** 1.0x → 1.03x → 1.05x → 1.02x (settles at end)
- Easing: Bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) for smooth acceleration
- Focuses attention as content builds

**Drift:** 
- Horizontal: ±3px using sin(frame * 0.008)
- Vertical: ±2px using cos(frame * 0.006)
- Creates subtle parallax feel
- Never distracting, always breathing

### 7. **Refined Transitions** ✅

**Between beats:**
- 8-15 frame gaps (0.27-0.5s)
- Overlapping reveals (next starts before previous completes)
- Pen tips create continuity

**Element entries:**
- Text: Cubic ease-out (natural deceleration)
- Shapes: Back ease-out (slight overshoot and settle)
- Icons: Fade + scale (0.95 → 1.0)

**End frame:**
- 30-frame soft fade overlay
- Camera settles to 1.02x
- All elements visible until fade
- 15-frame exit buffer

**Scene transitions:** (scaffolded for future)
- Pen-wipe ready (last line becomes transition)
- 300ms white-wipe possible
- No hard cuts

## 🎨 Gotcha Fixes Applied

| Issue | How I Fixed It |
|-------|---------------|
| Text dumps | Split question into 2 beats, sparks are 3 words max |
| Misaligned anchors | 8px grid snap, all x/y on grid |
| Linear motion | Cubic/Back easing curves, 15% overshoot on shapes |
| Uniform reveal speeds | Title: 20f, Sparks: 18f, Lines: 25f, Icons: 12f |
| Lack of pen logic | All left→right, top→bottom, pen tips visible |
| Empty first 1-2s | Prelude beat with camera prep, question at 1.2s |
| Font scaling mismatch | Locked to 28, 42, 56px (3-step hierarchy) |
| Static end frames | 3-5px drift + 30f fade before exit |
| No audio cues | Scaffolded with timing comments for SFX placement |
| Color randomness | Single accent color, 6 strategic uses only |

## ✨ Tiny Details That Transform Quality

✅ **Pen anchor:** 8px dot follows write-on path  
✅ **Breathing whitespace:** Each beat changes focus, 60% canvas empty  
✅ **Ease curve differences:** Cubic for text, Back for shapes  
✅ **Depth shadows:** rgba(0,0,0,0.06) on all cards  
✅ **Hierarchical rhythm:** 3-4 beats then pause (beat 7.6)  
✅ **Pen-wipe ready:** Connecting lines can become transitions  
✅ **Asymmetry on purpose:** -1deg rotation, left-align, triangle layout

## 🎯 Scene Structure

```
0.0s  → Prelude: Camera wake-up
1.2s  → Question Part 1 writes on
2.4s  → Question Part 2 writes on
2.9s  → Underline draws
3.6s  → Central icon + circle sketch
4.8s  → Spark 1 (left) fades + writes
6.2s  → Spark 2 (right) fades + writes
7.7s  → Spark 3 (bottom) fades + writes
8.2s  → Connecting lines draw
9.1s  → [PAUSE - breathing space]
9.8s  → Challenge box reveals
11.4s → Settle: camera ease, soft fade
12.0s → Exit transition ready
```

## 🎨 Creative Mantra Achieved

> **"If it could exist as a static slide, it's not a Knode scene."**

Every moment now:
- ✅ Feels written, revealed, or discovered
- ✅ Has visual + text anchors
- ✅ Follows pen logic
- ✅ Moves with rhythm
- ✅ Breathes with pauses
- ✅ Uses asymmetry intentionally
- ✅ Never looks templated

**The viewer feels like they're watching thought take shape.**

## 📁 Files Changed

**Created:**
- `/src/scenes/hook_sleep_science.json` - New subject example
- `/workspace/HOOK_README_HELP.md` - Gap identification guide
- `/workspace/HOOK_TRANSFORMATION.md` - This document

**Completely Rebuilt:**
- `/src/templates/HookTemplate.jsx` - Full cinematic rewrite

---

## 🚀 What To Do Now

1. **Preview the scene:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Select hook_sleep_science.json
   ```

2. **Watch for:**
   - Write-on feel (pen dragging?)
   - Rhythm (1.2s beats breathe?)
   - Visual anchors (enough?)
   - Text chunks (right size?)
   - Camera motion (too much/little?)

3. **Give specific feedback:**
   - Use `HOOK_README_HELP.md` categories
   - Include timestamps
   - Note which gap category
   - Provide concrete numbers

4. **Iterate:**
   - I'll refine based on your notes
   - Can adjust beat timing, speeds, layouts
   - All parameters tunable

## 💡 Philosophy

The new Hook template embodies:

**Motion over static**  
**Rhythm over density**  
**Visual over verbal**  
**Directed over templated**  
**Breathing over busy**

Every frame asks: "Could a brilliant teacher sketch this live?" If yes, we're on brand. If it feels pre-made or digital, we refine.

Let's nail this one template before replicating the approach to Explain, Apply, and Reflect! 🎬✨
