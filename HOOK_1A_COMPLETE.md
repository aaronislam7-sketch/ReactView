## What's Been Built

**Template:** `Hook1AQuestionBurst.jsx`  
**Scene:** `hook_1a_knodovia_map.json`  
**Status:** Ready to preview! ✨

## 🎬 What Makes This 9+/10

### 1. **NO MORE BOXES!** ✅
All visual elements use **rough.js** hand-drawn sketches:
- ❌ No CSS `border`, `borderRadius`, `background`
- ✅ Wobbly underlines drawn with rough.js
- ✅ Organic circle sketch (not perfect)
- ✅ Hand-drawn star bursts with hachure fills
- ✅ Scribble accent marks

### 2. **Dynamic, Varied Motion** ✅
Kinetic type system inspired by anime.js:
- Each text part has unique entrance
- Rotation offsets (-2deg, +1.5deg)
- Scale + translate + rotate combined
- Back-easing with 1.7 overshoot
- Never uniform, always organic

### 3. **Hand-Drawn Feel** ✅
Rough.js parameters tuned for sketch aesthetic:
```javascript
{
  roughness: 2-3,      // Wobble intensity
  bowing: 4-8,         // Line curve
  strokeWidth: 4-7,    // Marker weight
  fillStyle: 'hachure', // Crosshatch
  hachureGap: 8,       // Fill spacing
}
```

### 4. **Asymmetric Layout** ✅
- Left-aligned (not centered!)
- Second part indented 60px
- Rotation variance between parts
- Particles scattered organically
- Subtitle bottom-left (not centered)

### 5. **Breathing Motion** ✅
- 16 particles drift independently
- Each has unique sine/cosine path
- Rotation + position + scale all vary
- Camera zooms and drifts
- Pulse effect during pauses

## 🎯 Timing Structure

```
0.0s  → Prelude: Particles start drifting
1.0s  → Question Part 1 bursts in (kinetic)
2.4s  → Underline 1 draws (wobbly)
2.9s  → Question Part 2 bursts in (offset)
4.3s  → Underline 2 draws (thicker)
5.0s  → [PAUSE + BREATHING PULSE]
5.0s  → Accent circle sketches (organic)
6.0s  → Spark burst (4 stars stagger)
7.2s  → Subtitle fades in
9.0s  → Settle + soft fade
```

## 🎨 Rough.js Elements

All shapes are **hand-drawn sketches**, not CSS:

1. **Wobbly Underlines**
   - Bowing creates natural curve
   - Roughness adds wobble
   - Animates via progress-based reveal

2. **Organic Circle**
   - Not a perfect circle
   - Variable stroke thickness
   - Draws via strokeDashoffset

3. **Hand-Drawn Stars**
   - 5-pointed with inner/outer radius
   - Roughness + hachure fills
   - Each slightly different

4. **Scribble Marks**
   - Small decorative accents
   - High bowing for organic curves
   - Subtle opacity

## 🚀 How to Preview

**Dev server:** http://localhost:3000/

**Select:** "🆕 Hook 1A: Question Burst - Rough.js (20s)"

**Watch for:**
- ✅ Text bursts in with rotation + overshoot
- ✅ Underlines draw on (wobbly!)
- ✅ Circle sketches organically

## 🎯 What Makes This Different

### Before (6/10):
- CSS boxes with borders
- Uniform motion
- Centered layouts
- Predictable timing
- Digital feel

### After (9+/10):
- Rough.js hand-drawn shapes
- Kinetic, varied motion
- Asymmetric placement
- Dynamic timing with character
- Sketch-board feel

## 💡 Key Innovations

1. **Rough.js Integration**
   - All decorative elements are sketches
   - Parameters create organic variety
   - Stroke animation via getTotalLength()

2. **Kinetic Typography**
   - Rotation + translate + scale combined
   - Each text has unique motion signature
   - Back-easing creates bounce/overshoot

3. **Organic Particles**
   - 16 independent drift paths
   - Sine/cosine with phase offsets
   - Mix of circles and rounded squares

4. **Breathing Canvas**
   - Camera zoom/drift continuous
   - Pulse during pauses
   - Never static, never jittery

5. **Asymmetric Intention**
   - Left-aligned base
   - 60px indent on part 2
   - Rotation variance creates direction
   - Never perfectly centered

## 🔧 Customization

### Change Colors
```json
"style_tokens": {
  "colors": {
    "bg": "#FFF9F0",
    "accent": "#E74C3C",    // Main marker
    "accent2": "#E67E22",   // Secondary
    "ink": "#1A1A1A"        // Text
  }
}
```

### Adjust Timing
```json
"duration_s": 15,  // 10-20s range
```

### Modify Text
```json
"fill": {
  "texts": {
    "questionPart1": "Your first phrase",
    "questionPart2": "Your second phrase",
    "subtitle": "Optional hint text"
  }
}
```

## ✨ Next Steps

1. **Preview Hook 1A** - See the rough.js magic!
2. **Give specific feedback:**
   - Too wobbly or not enough?
   - Text motion too dramatic?
   - Timing feel right?
   - Need more/fewer particles?
   - Underlines prominent enough?

3. **Once dialed in:**
   - I'll apply same approach to Hook 1E
   - Then Explain 2A, 2B
   - Then Apply 3A, 3B
   - Then Reflect 4A, 4D

**All 8 templates will share this hand-drawn, kinetic aesthetic!** 🎨✨
