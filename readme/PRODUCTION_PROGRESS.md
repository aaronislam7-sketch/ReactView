# 🏗️ Production Refactor - Progress Update

**Goal:** Fix all issues to reach production-grade 9+/10 quality

---

## ✅ COMPLETED

### 1. Debug Overlay (DONE)
- ✅ Created `DebugOverlay` component
- ✅ Integrated into App.jsx
- ✅ Click-to-copy debug info with timestamp input
- ✅ Shows colors, content, scene JSON
- ✅ Provides feedback template

**Usage:** Click "🐛 Debug Mode" button → Enter timestamp → Click to copy info

### 2. Zero Wobble Foundation (DONE)
- ✅ Updated `roughHelpers.js` - all roughness/bowing → 0
- ✅ Documented "Zero Wobble Policy"
- ✅ Builds successfully

---

## ⏳ IN PROGRESS

### 3. Update All 8 Templates (IN PROGRESS)
Need to update every rough.js call in templates to use roughness: 0, bowing: 0

**Progress:**
- ⏳ Hook1AQuestionBurst.jsx (0/5 rough.js calls updated)
- ⏳ Hook1EAmbientMystery.jsx (0/4 rough.js calls)
- ⏳ Explain2AConceptBreakdown.jsx (0/6 rough.js calls)
- ⏳ Explain2BAnalogy.jsx (0/5 rough.js calls)
- ⏳ Apply3AMicroQuiz.jsx (0/3 rough.js calls)
- ⏳ Apply3BScenarioChoice.jsx (0/4 rough.js calls)
- ⏳ Reflect4AKeyTakeaways.jsx (0/4 rough.js calls)
- ⏳ Reflect4DForwardLink.jsx (0/5 rough.js calls)

**Total:** 0/36 rough.js calls updated

### 4. Fix Template 3B Overlap (PENDING)
- Issue: Text overlapping box outline at 2s
- Root cause: Scenario text positioning
- Fix: Adjust positioning + padding

---

## 📋 TODO (Phase 1 - Critical)

- [ ] Complete all template zero-wobble updates
- [ ] Fix Template 3B overlap issue
- [ ] Standardize fonts (use rough.js aesthetic everywhere)
- [ ] Test all templates at key timestamps (0s, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)

---

## 📋 TODO (Phase 2 - Features)

- [✅] ~~Actually integrate anime.js~~ **REPLACED WITH GSAP** (world-class animations)
  - ✅ GSAP installed and configured
  - ✅ Modular animation utilities created (800+ lines)
  - ✅ Mid-scene transitions implemented
  - ✅ Hook1a complete with GSAP
  - ⏳ Extend to remaining 7 templates
- [✅] Add Lottie support (JSON schema + component integration)
- [✅] Add imagery/icon support (images + emoji)
- [✅] Expand JSON schema to v4.0 (more user control)

---

## 📋 TODO (Phase 3 - Polish)

- [ ] Make templates visually distinct
- [ ] Improve scene-to-scene transitions
- [ ] Remove/improve eraser effect
- [ ] Validate all templates against acceptance criteria

- [ ] Clean animations (no jitter/wobble)
- [ ] Proper padding/spacing

### Animation Quality
- [ ] Lines draw smoothly
- [ ] Text reveals naturally
- [ ] Timing feels right
- [ ] Easing curves appropriate

### JSON Control

- [ ] Can adjust timing via JSON
- [ ] Can modify content easily
- [ ] Defaults make sense

---

**Status:** 🚀 Major milestone - GSAP animation system complete!
**Next:** Extend GSAP animations to remaining 7 templates

---

## 🎬 NEW: GSAP Animation System (COMPLETED)

### ✅ What's Done
- ✅ GSAP core library installed
- ✅ anime.js removed (outdated)
- ✅ Comprehensive animation utilities (`/src/utils/gsapAnimations.js`)
- ✅ Hook1AQuestionBurst.jsx updated with GSAP
- ✅ **Mid-scene transitions** working perfectly
- ✅ Build verified successful

### 🎯 Key Features Implemented
1. **DrawSVG** - Natural writing/drawing effects
2. **Shape Morphing** - Organic transformations (basic implementation)
3. **Flip Swap** - Quiz reveals and content replacement
4. **Staggered Bullets** - Professional stepwise reveals
5. **Emphasis** - Pulse, underline, highlight, glow
6. **Scramble Text** - Hook moments
7. **Mid-Scene Transitions** - Content repositioning during scene ⭐

### 📖 Documentation
See `GSAP_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` for:
- Complete animation reference
- Implementation patterns
- Template extension guide
- When to use which animation

### 🎬 Hook1a Showcase
The Hook1a template now demonstrates:
- Question appears with kinetic energy
- Underlines draw naturally
- Pulse emphasis on key words
- **Question gracefully moves to top mid-scene**
- New content (subtitle + icons) cascade in
- All animations fluid and organic

### ⏳ Next: Extend to Other Templates
1. Hook1E (mystery/scramble effects)
2. Explain2A (staggered bullets)
3. Explain2B (shape morphing for analogies)
4. Apply3A (flip reveals for quiz)
5. Apply3B (content swaps)
6. Reflect4A (cascade reveals)
7. Reflect4D (graceful transitions)
