## ‚úÖ New Templates Created

### 1. ExplainSequentialTemplate
**File:** `/src/templates/ExplainSequentialTemplate.jsx`

**Purpose:** Sequential reveals for multi-part explanations (like the 4 regions)

**Features:**

- NOT a grid - items appear one after another vertically
- Each item gets: icon, name, description, optional annotation

- Connecting lines draw between items
- Write-on text reveals with pen tips

**Perfect for:** Multi-step processes, sequential concepts, region/category breakdowns

### 2. ApplyQuizTemplate
**File:** `/src/templates/ApplyQuizTemplate.jsx`

**Purpose:** Multiple choice questions with answer reveal

**Features:**
- Context section (optional)
- Question card
- 4 options (A, B, C, D) appear sequentially
- Pause with pulse effect (thinking time)
- Correct answer highlights green with checkmark
- Incorrect options fade
- Confetti burst on reveal
