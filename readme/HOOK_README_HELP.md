# Hook Template - Common Gaps Guide

## Why This Document Exists

The Hook template now uses **cinematic write-on mechanics** with beat-based timing. This guide helps identify common gaps between the brief and output so I can refine it precisely.

---

## üéØ 12 Common Gap Categories

### 1. TEXT DENSITY
**Gap:** Text still feels like paragraphs, not bite-sized chunks

**Questions:**
- Are phrases too long? (currently 3-6 words per chunk)
- Should I split further? (e.g., "What if" ‚Üí "your brain" ‚Üí "could change")
- Do pauses between text feel too short?

### 2. WRITE-ON FEEL
**Gap:** Animation doesn't feel hand-drawn/natural

**Questions:**
- Should write-on be faster/slower? (currently 20 frames = 0.67s)
- Is pen tip visible enough? (currently 8px dot)
- Want curved pen paths instead of straight reveals?
- Should different elements have different speeds?

### 3. VISUAL ANCHORS
**Gap:** Not enough icons/sketches paired with text

**Questions:**
- What visual style? (emoji, hand-drawn, icons, diagrams?)
- Should every text have a paired visual?
- Want visuals to draw-on or just appear?
- Need SVG sketches vs. provided images?

### 4. RHYTHM & PACING
**Gap:** Timing feels rushed or dragging

**Questions:**
- Is 1.2s per beat right? (currently 36 frames)
- Where need longer pauses? (currently one at beat 7.6)
- Which beats should linger?
- Need audio timing markers?

### 5. LAYOUT SYMMETRY
**Gap:** Feels too templated or grid-locked

**Questions:**
- Need more asymmetry? (currently: left-align question, triangle sparks)
- Should I break the grid intentionally?
- Where needs more breathing room?
- Want 70/30 splits vs. centered?

### 6. CAMERA MOTION
**Gap:** Too static or too distracting

**Questions:**
- Zoom more/less? (currently 1.0 ‚Üí 1.05)
- Drift amount? (currently ¬±3px, ¬±2px)
- Want parallax on layers?
- Zoom to focus on specific moments?

### 7. BEAT TRANSITIONS
**Gap:** Elements pop rather than flow

**Questions:**
- Should elements overlap in time?
- Want motion carryover between beats?
- Connecting lines draw earlier?
- Need fade-overlaps?

### 8. TYPOGRAPHY HIERARCHY
**Gap:** Can't tell what's important

**Questions:**
- Question size right? (currently 56px)
- Sparks too big/small? (currently 28px)
- Challenge prominent enough? (currently 42px)
- Need different font families?

### 9. COLOR USAGE
**Gap:** Accent overused or underused

**Questions:**
- Limit accent more? (currently 6 uses)
- Need secondary accent?
- Different colors per beat?
- Where should color pop most?

### 10. PEN LOGIC
**Gap:** Doesn't follow how real pen moves

**Questions:**
- Strictly left‚Üíright, top‚Üíbottom?
- Want visible pen trails?
- Elements build vs. unmask?
- Need bezier curve paths?

### 11. END FRAME
**Gap:** Exit feels abrupt

**Questions:**
- Hold longer at end? (currently 30 frames)
- Fade or wipe transition?
- Final element linger or drift?
- Want "pen lift" animation?

### 12. SCENE DURATION
**Gap:** Overall timing wrong

**Questions:**
- Too rushed/slow? (currently 12s)
- Which beats need more/less time?
- Need voiceover sync timing?
- Prefer 15-20s total?

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Tuning Numbers

```javascript
// Rhythm
BEAT = 36 frames (1.2s)
totalBeats = 9.5 (~12s)

// Animation speeds  
writeOn = 20 frames (0.67s)
fadeIn = 15 frames (0.5s)
lineDraw = 25 frames (0.83s)

// Camera
zoom = 1.0 ‚Üí 1.05
drift = ¬±3px, ¬±2px

// Typography
question = 56px
sparks = 28px
challenge = 42px

// Grid
24 columns √ó 14 rows
8px snap
```

## üìù How To Give Feedback

**Best:** "At 3.2s, third spark write-on should be 50% faster and start with icon not text"

**Unclear:** "Animation doesn't feel right"

**Include:**
- Timestamps (e.g., "at 4.5 seconds")
- Element names (e.g., "the challenge box")
- Specific numbers (e.g., "200% slower")
- Priority (critical vs. nice-to-have)
