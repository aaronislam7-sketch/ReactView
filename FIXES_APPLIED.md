# 🔧 Fixes Applied

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Validation Errors Fixed
**Problem**: Timeline actions referenced missing targets (mainIcon, connector1, connector2, connector3)

**Solution**: Updated validation logic in `App.jsx` to recognize special template-specific targets that don't need to be in the `fill` object.

```javascript
const specialTargets = ['character_anchor', 'mainIcon', 'connector1', 'connector2', 'connector3', 'connector4'];
```

**Result**: ✅ No more validation warnings when clicking "Apply Changes"

---

### 2. ✅ Video Duration Extended to 20s
**Problem**: Only 8 seconds of actual content despite 20-second video length

**Solution**: 
- Extended animation timings throughout the full 20 seconds
- Added more timeline actions with longer durations
- Added emphasis phase (8-16s) where each point gets highlighted for 2 seconds
- Conclusion appears at 16s and animates until end

**New Timeline**:
- 0-6s: Title, icon, and all 4 boxes appear sequentially
- 8-16s: Each point highlighted for 2 seconds (giving time to read)
- 16-20s: Conclusion appears and scales for emphasis

**Result**: ✅ Full 20 seconds of engaging content

---

### 3. ✅ Text and Boxes Properly Aligned
**Problem**: Text and boxes weren't properly aligned, looking odd

**Solution**:
- Fixed flexbox layout for content boxes
- Centered text within boxes using proper flex properties
- Added proper padding and spacing
- Number badges now properly centered above each box
- Icons centered within boxes
- Text uses `textAlign: 'center'` and proper line-height

**CSS Improvements**:
```javascript
{
  display: 'flex',
  flexDirection: 'column',
  alignItems: 'center',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  gap: 20,
  textAlign: 'center'
}
```

**Result**: ✅ Everything perfectly aligned and visually balanced

---

### 4. ✅ Removed "Shimmering" Effect
**Problem**: Rough.js sketch rendering created a shimmering/flickering effect that was hard on the eyes

**Solution**:
- **Completely removed** Rough.js canvas rendering
- Replaced with clean CSS boxes using:
  - Solid `border` property (3px solid)
  - Clean `borderRadius` for rounded corners
  - Static `boxShadow` for depth
  - Solid color fills
- All animations now use smooth CSS transforms and opacity
- No canvas redrawing on every frame

**Before**: Hand-drawn sketch lines that redrew each frame
**After**: Clean, solid borders that animate smoothly

**Result**: ✅ Smooth, easy-on-the-eyes animations with no flicker
